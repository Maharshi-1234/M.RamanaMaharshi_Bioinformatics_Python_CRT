## â—‡ Scenario 1: Vignan Campus Map
'''
Context: Each building in a college campus is a node, and walkable paths are edges.
- Represent the campus map using an adjacency list.
- Check if there's a path from the Library to the Auditorium using BFS.
- List all buildings that are directly connected to the Admin Block.
- Use DFS to visit all reachable buildings from the Main Gate.
- Find if there are any disconnected buildings (buildings not connected to campus).
