                                        DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS(DSA)
Data: It is a raw fact which describes the attributes or properties of an Entity.
Structure: It is a Structured Format of arranging Data.
Data Structures: The process of Organising the Data is called Data Structures.
CRUD - Creation/Insertion
       Read/Retrieve
       Update/Modify
       Deletion/Remove
Algorithms : A process or set of instructions to perform a task.

Big-O-Notation(O)- worst case scenario
Omega Notation(Ω) - Best Case scenario
Theta Notation(θ) - Average Complexity of an Algorithm.

Linked Lists: 1)Singly-Linked Lists:Contains only one node which points out subsequent pointer.
              2)Doubly-Linked Lists:Each node points not only to next pointer but also to the previous pointer.
              3)Circular-Linked Lists: No Tail Node.
              4)Circular Doubly-Linked Lists: Combination of Both Doubly Linked Lists and Circular List.

Operations on Linked List:
1)Traversing:✔ Follow the pointers
             ✔ Display the contents of the nodes as they were traversed.
             ✔ Stop when the next pointer points to None.

2)Printing :  Traversing the list from begining of the list(head) until we reach the None Pointer

3)Insertion : ✔ Before the Head of the begining
              ✔ After the Tail
              ✔ Middle of the List(Random Location)
              
4)Deletion : ✔ Deleting the First Node
             ✔ Deleting the an Intermediate Node
             ✔ Deleting the Last Node
