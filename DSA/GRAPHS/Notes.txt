#Introduction

A graph is a pair  G = (V, E), where  V  is a set whose elements are called vertices, and \( E \) is a 
set of two sets of vertices, whose elements are called edges.

The vertices \( x \) and \( y \) of an edge \(\{x, y\}\) are called the endpoints of the edge. 
The edge is said to join \( x \) and \( y \) and to be incident on \( x \) and \( y \). 
A vertex may not belong to any edge.

For example: Suppose there is a road network in a country, where we have many cities, and roads are 
connecting these cities. There could be some cities that are not connected by some other cities like an island.

Graph Operations : Add vertex, 
                   Add Edge, 
                   Remove vertex, 
                   Remove Edge, 
                   Display Graph,
                   Traversal,
                   View Edges,
                   Get Neighbour Nodes

Nodes = vertices and connection between them are called edges.
Degree = Number of edges that are incident to it.
Path = A Collection of edges through which we can reach from one node to another node.
A Graph is said to be connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices.
The min.number of edges in a connected graph is N-1 (N=Number of Nodes)
In a complete graph, There are NC2, number of edges = (N*(N-1))/2 edges where n = number of nodes.

DFS(Depth First Search):Take input and print graph
It is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from a source node and explores as far 
as possible along each branch before backtracking.
It uses a stack (either explicitly or via recursion) and goes deep into one path before trying others."

BFS(Breadth First Search):
It is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from a source node and explores 
all its neighbors first before moving to the next level neighbors.
It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit next, ensuring it explores nodes in a level-by-level manner.
