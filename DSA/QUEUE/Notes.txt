Queues are type of Data structures which follows Sequential Data Reperesentation.
Follows FIFO(First-in-First-Out)
Add Element only from the BackSide.
Operations : Enqueue(insert Element from last), Dequeue(remove Element from front) , Peek Front(look at front item) and Peek Rear(look ar rear item)
Applications : 1)Task Scheduling in OS
               2)Print Job Management
               3)BFS Algorithms
               4)Customer service systems
               5)Data Buffering

Difference between Stacks vs Queues :
                STACK(LIFO)                                         QUEUES(FIFO)
        * Add/Removefrom same end(loop)                    * Add at rear, remove from First
        * Like a stack of plates                           * Like a line of People
        * Operations : push,pop,Peek                       * Operations : Enqueue,Dequeue,Peek
        * Use: Undo operations,function calls              * Use: Task Scheduling, Printing
