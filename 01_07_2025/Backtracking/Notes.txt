A Backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for 
finding the desired output.
--> The brute force approach tries out all the possible solutions and chooses the desired solutions.
--> The Backtracking suggests that is the current solution is not suitable, then Backtrack and try 
    other solutions.Thus, recursion is used in this approach.
--> This approach is used to solve problems that have multiple solutions.
--> Backtracking is thus a form of recursion.

Problems in Backtracking:
1)Decision problem : search for feasible solution
2)Optimization Problem : search for best solution
3)Enumeration Problem : search for all feasible solutions

Difference Between recursion and Backtracking
A recursion,Function calls itself until it reaches a base case.In Backtracking, we use recursion to explore
all the possibilities until we get the best result for the problem.
